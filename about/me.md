# About Me
## My name is Gwen Shackleford and I am a senior at Texas A&M University. Whoop! Here are some fun facts about me: 
### - I am an English major
### - I have played the piano since I was 9
### - I am definitely a dog person, but I do have a soft spot for cats. 
### - I have walked the Great Wall of China! 
### - Despite being from Texas, I have been to Michigan more than I've been to Austin or San Antonio.
